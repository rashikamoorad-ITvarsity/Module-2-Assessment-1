            <strong> <h3>WARTHOG</h3> </strong>
   <p>Although covered in bristly hairs, their bodies and heads appear largely naked from a distance, with only the crest along the back, and the tufts on their cheeks and tails being obviously haired. The English name refers to their facial wattles, which are particularly distinct in males. They also have very distinct tusks, which reach a length of 10 to 25 inches (25 to 64 centimetres) in the males, but are always smaller in the females.</p>
       <p>They are largely herbivorous, but occasionally also eat small animals.</p> 
    <p>They are pigs who live in open and semi-open habitats, even in quite arid regions, in sub-Saharan Africa. </p>
