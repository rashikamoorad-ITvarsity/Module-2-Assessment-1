            <strong> <h3>GIRAFFE</h3> </strong>
            <p>The giraffe is a tall African even-toed hoofed mammal.It is the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant.The giraffe's chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-like ossicones, and its distinctive coat patterns.</p> 
            <p>Lions, leopards, spotted hyenas and African wild dogs may prey upon giraffes. Giraffes live in herds of related females and their offspring, or bachelor herds. Males establish social hierarchies through "necking", which are combat bouts where the neck is used as a weapon. Dominant males gain mating access to females, which bear the sole responsibility for raising the young.</p> 
            <p>Giraffe's are herbivores feeding mainly on evergreen trees and bushes.</p>
