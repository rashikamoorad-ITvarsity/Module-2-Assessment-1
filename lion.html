            <strong> <h3>LION</h3> </strong>
    <p>The lion is a large cat of the genus Panthera native to Africa and India. It has a muscular, deep-chested body, short, rounded head, round ears, and a hairy tuft at the end of its tail.Adult male lions are larger than females and have a prominent mane. It is a social species, forming groups called prides. A lion's pride consists of a few adult males, related females, and cubs. Groups of female lions usually hunt together. The lion is an apex and keystone predator.</p>
    <p>The lion inhabits grasslands, savannas, shrublands and dry deciduous forests. It is usually more diurnal than other wild cats, but when persecuted, it adapts to being active at night and at twilight. </p> 
    <p>Lions spend much of their time resting; they are inactive for about twenty hours per day.Although lions can be active at any time, their activity generally peaks after dusk with a period of socialising, grooming and defecating. Intermittent bursts of activity continue until dawn, when hunting most often takes place. They spend an average of two hours a day walking and fifty minutes eating.</p>                       
   <strong><h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3></strong>
 <p>You will find the Lion's next to the Elepants, at Pen E24.</p>
