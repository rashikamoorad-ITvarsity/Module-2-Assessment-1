            <strong> <h3>GEMSBOK</h3> </strong>
            <p>Gemsbok is light taupe to tan in color, with lighter patches toward the bottom rear of the rump. Their tails are long and black in color. A blackish stripe extends from the chin down the lower edge of the neck, through the juncture of the shoulder and leg.They have muscular necks and shoulders, and their legs have white 'socks' with a black patch on the front of both the front legs, and both genders have long, straight horns.</p>
            <p>Gemsbok are widely hunted for their spectacular horns that average 85 cm (33 in) in length. From a distance, the only outward difference between males and females is their horns, and many hunters mistake females for males each year. The males horns tend to be thicker with larger bases. Females have slightly longer, thinner horns.Female gemsbok use their horns to defend themselves and their offspring from predators, while males primarily use their horns to defend their territories from other males.</p> 
            <p>The gemsbok is generally a grazer but changes to browsing during the dry season or when grass is sparse. It may dig up to a meter deep to find roots and tubers, supplementing its water intake by eating wild tsama melons and cucumbers, which can provide all the water required.</p>               
    
   <strong><h3>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM?</h3></strong>
    <p>You will find the Gemsbok at Pen E25, right next to the Panda's.</p>
