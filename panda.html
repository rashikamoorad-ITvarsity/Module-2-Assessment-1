            <strong> <h3>PANDA</h3> </strong>
<p>Panda's have luxuriant black-and-white fur.The panda has a body shape typical of bears. It has black fur on its ears, eye patches, muzzle, legs, arms and shoulders. The rest of the animal's coat is white.The giant panda's thick, woolly coat keeps it warm in the cool forests of its habitat.</p>   
<p>The panda's diet is primarily herbivorous.The panda still has the digestive system of a carnivore, as well as carnivore-specific genes, and thus derives little energy and little protein from consumption of bamboo. Its ability to digest cellulose is ascribed to the microbes in its gut.Pandas are born with sterile intestines and require bacteria obtained from their mother's feces to digest vegetation.[55] The panda is a highly specialised animal with unique adaptations, and has lived in bamboo forests for millions of years</p>
<p>The panda is a terrestrial animal and primarily spends its life roaming and feeding in the bamboo forests.Pandas are generally solitary.Each adult has a defined territory and a female is not tolerant of other females in her range. Social encounters occur primarily during the brief breeding season in which pandas in proximity to one another will gather.After mating, the male leaves the female alone to raise the cub.</p>
